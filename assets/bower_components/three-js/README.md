three-js
========

three-js is a set of three-js elements wrapped as custom webcomponents made for
usage in [ThreeJS.jl](https://github.com/rohitvarkey/ThreeJS.jl).

# Set up

```bash
bower install rohitvarkey/three-js
```

If you are editing a local Git repository, you can also do `bower install ./.#branch`, where "branch" is the name of your Git branch. This allows for
easier development.

Now run a server from the top level directory and try visiting `bower_components/three-js/test.html`
in your browser! For example, this is done easily with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`,
which makes http://localhost:8000/bower_components/three-js/test.html the URL.
